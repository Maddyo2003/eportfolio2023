<p><span data-contrast="auto">The beautiful island of Kona Hawaii was the first place I traveled to after a year and a half of staying put due to COVID-19. This trip was truly a breath of fresh air. COVID-19 so quickly took so much away from us, but this experience truly allowed me to appreciate travel, to appreciate our world, and to appreciate nature.&nbsp;Instead of being angry at those moments we may have lost, take it as a learning experience to never take a single moment of this wonderful life we live for granted. So, take the trip, I promise you won't regret it. </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">EDU-VENTURE TRAVEL </span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Each year, Edu-Venture travel, a New York based company, releases their yearly travel dates for high school students. Traveling with Edu-Venture provides students with new sets of skills and provides them with opportunities that a classroom setting would never be able to match. This year, the program is traveling to Azores, Spain, Germany, and Costa Rica. Students have the opportunity to choose which location they wish to travel to. The chaperones are teachers as well, which enhances the educational experience. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">MY EXPERIENCE WITH EDU-VENTURE TRAVEL </span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">My senior year of high school, 2020-2021, I decided to sign up for the Edu-Ventures trip to Hawaii. My best friend Meg and I did our research and started the process. We attended zoom meetings, filled out health forms, sent in our license and personal information, made payments, etc. We convinced two more of our friends to join in on the trip as well. Due to the circumstances of COVID-19, we were still unsure if the trip would actually happen. We would be traveling in the summer, which at the time was a few months away. Of course, we had to get tested before leaving so there was a fear that some of us would not be able to attend. As stressful as it was, we stayed optimistic and hoped for the best. When the summer finally rolled around, everything worked out in our favor, and we were off to Hawaii!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">MY FIRST TIME TRAVELING IN ALMOST 2 YEARS</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I wouldn’t say it was uncomfortable, but it was definitely a weird experience packing up my suitcase and walking into an airport after our world had been shut down. As much as it felt weird, I was excited. This is something I had not been able to do and finally, I was able to do it. Our flight departed from JFK airport, and we had a layover in Arizona. After our layover we would fly to Kona Hawaii (KOA) airport.&nbsp;I think we were all excited. Especially the chaperones and the founders of the company. In that moment, getting on the plane and taking off, it felt so good. It really set in that this is what I had been dreaming of for a year and a half, getting my life back and being able to just get out. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">THE FEELING OF GETTING OFF THE PLANE</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It was crazy to be somewhere other than New York, let alone that somewhere being Hawaii. I had never been before, and I got to experience it alongside one of my best friends. The lush greenery and blue skies were what I immediately noticed when I got off the plane. There really is nothing quite like it. The airport was also completely outdoors which is something I was not used to. Our travel group took two buses to our hotel where we were staying for half of the trip. We would then travel around the Island to Hilo where we would stay for a few nights and then return back to Kona for the remainder of our stay. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The black sand beach was one of my favorite parts. I have never experienced&nbsp;a black sand beach. We were also lucky enough to see sea turtles. I have also never been able to get so close up to one. They were huge! I found it amazing how sand can be black. I know it sounds silly, but it’s something I have never thought of before. Turtles are one of my favorite animals and I was praying that I would see one in Hawaii. They were much bigger than I had expected. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This experience was the highlight of my trip. We took buses up to the mountain and then hiked the remainder of it. The hike was steep and when we reached the top, the sun was just about to set. The craziest part was that as we got closer and closer to the top, the temperature dropped drastically. It went from about 75 degrees to just above 30 degrees at the top of the mountain. The sunset was beautiful and as it got darker, there was a sky filled with billions of stars. I have never in my life seen anything like it. It was at that moment I truly realized how lucky I was to be there. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">A SKY FULL OF STARS</span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">If you look closely at the picture above, you can see hundreds of stars. I took this photo while lying on the ground of a once active lava site. There is much less air pollution in Hawaii which is the reason why we were able to see the stars so clearly. I can remember this moment like it was yesterday. Our entire group just sprawled out&nbsp;on the ground and stared up at the sky in silence. I think this was a moment for all of us to really step back and be present. I have never experienced anything like it. This moment was truly one of the highlights of my trip to Hawaii. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The trip consisted of many different hikes. Hiking is one of my favorite things to do. Where I am from, I hike frequently but this was nothing compared to what I am used to. Some of the trails were very narrow and steep. It was definitely a challenge. The most amazing part about hiking in Hawaii is that when you reach the end, there usually is something amazing waiting for you. Whether it be a rainbow, a beautiful view, a waterfall, etc. The picture above was a view from one of my favorite hikes. The waterfall mixed with the lush greens was truly breathtaking. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE LAVA TUBE </span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Personally, when I think of Hawaii, I think of the luscious green foliage but also volcanoes and lava. In Hilo, we were able to walk through a once active lava site along with hiking up a currently active lava site called Mauna Loa. One of the coolest experiences was being able to walk through a lava tube which is what is photographed in the image above. This lava tube clearly was not active and there was a walkway built within it. When we walked through the tube, it was dark and surprisingly cold. I loved how we were able to experience both active lava sights and inactive ones. This was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">One of the most amazing parts of this trip was that it was students from all around New York. When we arrived, the only people I knew were the four students from my school. But, as the trip went on, we made new friends and new connections. It was really nice being surrounded by new people. You get to hear their stories and their experiences. Especially during COVID-19, we could not meet new people face to face or really see anyone. It was a great feeling to be able to interact with people again normally. The people truly made the trip. We all created amazing memories that we will never forget.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">MY ONE PIECE OF ADVICE WOULD BE.... </span></strong><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Take the trip, I can promise you won’t regret it. Traveling and experiencing Kona Hawaii is something I will never forget. COVID-19 so quickly took so much away from us, but this experience truly allowed me to appreciate travel, to appreciate our world, and to appreciate nature.&nbsp;Instead of being angry at those moments we may have lost, take it as a learning experience to never take a single moment of this wonderful life we live for granted. I have continued to feel inspired to travel, experience new places, try new things, and just live my life. During COVID-19 I really struggled. I felt angry at the world and angry at myself for not doing more while I could. I now look back at that experience and take it as something to learn from. On the days where we want to say no to doing something, are scared to do something, or feel like doing something isn't worth doing, remind yourself to just do it. Do not take a single moment for granted. We only get so many. This trip has continued to teach me important lessons even after two years. I will never forget the people or this amazing place. A piece of me will always be on the island of Kona, Hawaii. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
